# TicTacToe
This is a mini console game to improve my knowledge in basic C++

I'll be adding SDL2 to this project as soon as I learn it (sounds easy) and probably, some intelligence for the CPU just so it doesn't choose randomly everytime.

In case you want to test the game, you can just download the .exe file and execute it. 

IMPORTANT: if you execute the program without having MinGW installed, you will need to extract both .dll in the lib folder next to the .exe
